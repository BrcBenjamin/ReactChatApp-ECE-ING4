## About

We are building a Chat application. This chat application will offer different channels
that a user can indidually select. They will redirect him to the page of the desired channel.
Each channel contains different content that is unique to the channel

The backend for the channels is developped using `Node.js` , more specifically using `Express.js`

The frontend will be developped using `HTML CSS Javascript`as well as the `React` framework

## Usage

To launch the app, make sure you are in the folder containing index.js.

In the command prompt, enter the following command :

`npm run develop`

Your server should then be running on the designated port `localhost:3000`
